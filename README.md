# Trucks-Committed
This python program allows you to select an excel spreadsheet (Trucking Report) gathering the desired data using pandas, openpyxl, and pysimplegui. The desired data is put into a separate excel sheet (Trucks Committed). PDtrucking.py was the original program before swithing over to a gui and becoming more dynamic.
